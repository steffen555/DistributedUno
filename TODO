- look into joining in the middle of a game again; got "cannot convert an
  encrypted value to a card" when a new player joined the original host after
  a while..
- "in turn" is hard to see properly
- need to be able to pick number of players without recompiling
- name of player
- press "4" to play that card
- print many cards better
- tweak crypto security without recompiling
- put it into a jar
- direction of game ("c" card)
- pending draws
- debugging to log file (including timestamps)
- when there are too many cards the lines wrap
